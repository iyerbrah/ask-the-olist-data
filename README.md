# Text-to-SQL Scorecard

Ask a business question in plain English and get the answer from a real database, along
with the SQL that produced it. Then see how often those answers are actually right.

**Try it:** https://text-to-sql-scorecard-xgu4cnfjvj5qghjrasbdkh.streamlit.app/

## The finding

A language model given only the table and column names answered **83%** of 60 test
questions correctly. Given a page of written notes explaining what the data means, it
answered **98%**. Nothing else that was tried made a measurable difference.

The model was never bad at SQL. It was missing what the business means by its own words:
what counts as revenue, and what counts as a customer.

## What it does

Type a question such as *"Which 5 categories have the highest revenue?"* and the app:

1. Sends the question to a language model, together with notes describing the database.
2. Gets a SQL query back.
3. Checks the query is safe to run (read-only, one statement).
4. Runs it and shows the result table, a chart, and the SQL itself.

| category | revenue |
|---|---|
| health_beauty | 1,233,131.72 |
| watches_gifts | 1,166,176.98 |
| bed_bath_table | 1,023,434.76 |
| sports_leisure | 954,852.55 |
| computers_accessories | 888,724.61 |

The data is the public Olist dataset: about 100,000 orders from a Brazilian online
marketplace, 2016 to 2018, across eight tables.

## How accuracy is measured

The repository contains 60 test questions, each with a reference SQL query whose answer
was checked against the database.

| Difficulty | Questions | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Easy | 15 | How many orders were canceled? |
| Medium | 20 | Which 5 customer states placed the most orders? |
| Hard | 15 | How many customers have placed more than one order? |
| Cannot be answered | 10 | What is the profit margin for each category? |

A generated query counts as correct when it returns the same table as the reference
query. The SQL text does not have to match, because two different queries can both be
right. For the last group, the correct response is to say the data cannot answer it.

The hard questions are hard because of the data, not the SQL. For example, the customer
id in this dataset changes with every order, so counting repeat customers with the
obvious column always gives zero.

## Results

Each row adds one thing to the row above it, to show what that addition is worth.

| What the model was given | Correct | Hard questions |
|---|---|---|
| Table and column names only | 50 of 60 (83%) | 6 of 15 |
| + written notes about the data | 59 of 60 (98%) | 15 of 15 |
| + six worked examples | 58 of 60 (97%) | 15 of 15 |
| + a second attempt if the SQL fails | 59 of 60 (98%) | 15 of 15 |
| Everything, on a model costing a fifth as much | 57 of 60 (95%) | 15 of 15 |

What this shows:

- **The written notes do almost all the work.** Without them, 9 of the 15 hard questions
  fail, and every failure is a missing business rule. The SQL was valid each time.
- **Worked examples and the second attempt added nothing measurable.** Those rows differ
  by one question, which is within the variation between runs. The second attempt was
  never needed: no generated query failed to run.
- **The examples caused a new mistake.** One example filters revenue to delivered orders.
  After seeing it, both models added that filter to questions that did not ask for it.
  All three errors of the cheaper model are this one mistake.
- **The "cannot be answered" questions are too easy.** All 10 were refused in every row,
  so they are not a real test yet.

Every failed question, with the generated and the reference SQL side by side, is on the
Scorecard page of the live app.

## Limits

- Each row is one run, so a difference of one or two questions means nothing.
- 60 questions on one database is a small test.
- The notes and the questions were written together, so the hard questions measure
  whether the model follows stated rules, not whether it could work them out.
- Scoring is lenient: a result with extra columns still counts as correct.

## Safety

The app runs SQL written by a model, from text typed by anyone, so it does not rely on
the model behaving:

- The query is parsed, and anything other than a single `SELECT` is rejected.
- The database connection is read-only.
- Queries cannot read files or web addresses.
- Results are capped at 1,000 rows and 15 seconds.

## Cost

All five benchmark runs together cost about $0.09 in model usage.

## Run it yourself

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download the Olist dataset from Kaggle and unzip the CSVs into `data/`.
3. `python build_db.py`
4. Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` containing one line: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your-key"`.
5. `streamlit run app.py`

To rerun the benchmark: `python evaluate.py --setup all`
